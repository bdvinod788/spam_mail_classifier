### SPAM MAIL CLASSIFIER

## Desciption

Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the internet today. In 2019, on average, every person was receiving 130 emails each day, out of which more than 50% were spam emails. Even in the current date, people lose millions of dollars to frauds every day.

This is a supervised learning problem, as we will be using a labelled dataset, and then the model will predict whether the mail is a spam(junk) or ham(not junk) mail. Spam mail contain words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. I've tried many different classification algorithms, and then chosen the best algorithm. The algorithm with the best precision and accuracy was chosen, with precision having the higher weightage.
